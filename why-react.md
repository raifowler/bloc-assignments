**Questions**
> In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.

A:  A single page application is an application that dynamically loads content on a page without having to reload the entire page. A single page application car rewrite a small portion of a page while leaving the rest of the page untouched. In this way, it behaves more like a native desktop application than a standard web application. Progressive web apps are reliable, fast, and engaging. Progressive web apps use a service worker. A service worker minimizes the extent that a web app is reliant on the network as much as possible, so the web app can load regardless of the network state. A service worker also allows a web app to perform functions while offline. A progressive web app also has similar functionality to a native app, so the user experience is engaging and enjoyable.
