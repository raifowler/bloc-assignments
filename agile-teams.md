> What is a Kanban board?

A: A Kanban Board is a board, physical or digital, that is used to keep a project organized by arranging different aspects of the project on cards, and assigning them to columns on the board that reflect what phase that aspect of the project is in. 

> Why do we use a Kanban board in Agile development?

A: We use Kanban boards in Agile development to stay organized, and to have an easy depiction of every task of a project and what phase it is in. 

> Explain velocity, sprint, user story, card, and agile as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example for each.

A: Agile is a form of project management that uses columns to seperate different phases of a project, and cards to define the actual work needed to be done in a project. For example, if I were planning an event, I might have a column for 30 days before,  2 weeks before, 1 week before, day before, and day of. The 30 days before column would contain cards that needed to be completed 30 days before the event, the 2 weeks before column would contain cards that needed to be completed 2 weeks before the event, and so on and so forth for the rest of the columns. A card is a container that details the actual work that needs to be completed in a project. Each card would have a user story, tasks, epic, and any other relevant details. It would also contain an estimation which defines the size and complexity of the card. A user story is a method used to describe the outcome of successfully completing the work on a card. For example, as an event planner, I want to know how many people are coming to the event, so I can order the correct amount of food. A sprint is a time delimited period of work. For example the sprint for our event will be a 30 day sprint. Velocity is the rate at which a development team works during a sprint.  

> What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons of each method. Which method would you prefer?

A: Planning poker, good for a small number of items (2 to 10). Bucket system, quicker than planning poker and can be used for large number of items (50 to 500). Big, uncertain and small method, very fast, but has a very limiteed scale, only three items on the scale. T-shirt sizes, non numerical system, which is both good and bad, good in that it allows a team to think about estimation differently than the typical numerical scales, bad because the sizes are up for debate, and at some point need to be converted into a numerical scale for velocity calculations. I tihnk I would prefer the bucket system. 

> Explain the difference between tasks, cards, stories, slices, and epics, as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the breakdown of pieces into each type.

A: Tasks are the units of work that need to be completed to fulfill a user story. For example, if my user story is, as an event planner, I want to know how many people are coming to the event, so I can order the correct amount of food, my tasks might be: create guest list, create RSVP cards, mail RSVP cards to guests, tally RSVP card responses. Cards are the units of a project that contain a user story, tasks, epic, and any other relevant details. Stories are what define the outcome of the tasks that get completed. For example, as an event planner, I want to know how many people are coming to the event, so I can order the correct amount of food.Slices are a method of breaking up work for better organization. Slices further break apart an epic for the purpose of measuring progress and defining milestones. Epics are differenct features or products being developed in relation to the main goal. For example, the event you are working on would probably have epics for food, music, venue, host, and schedule. Being that this is an event you could slice each of these epics into time sensitive milestones. 30 days before, 2 weeks before, 2 days before, etc. 

> What format makes a good user story?

A: User stories should be written in the format, "As a _____, I want _____, So _____".

> What elements should a card include?

A: A card should include an estimation, User Story, Tasks, Epic, and any other relevant details.

> How does an idea go from conception to production?

A: You start with prioritization, estimation, and planning before the sprint. Then the sprint occurs, and after that review and retrospective meetings. 

> Why do development teams use Kanban boards?

A: We use Kanban boards in Agile development to stay organized, and to have an easy depiction of every task of a project and what phase it is in. 

> What is the purpose of estimation?

A: To assign each card a value based on it's size and complexity.

> What is the sprint cycle?

A: The sprint cycle is the total length of time that the defined work will occur.

> What could go wrong when estimating cards? How would you mitigate these risks?

A: Different opinions of the scale being used. One persons large may be another persons extra large. You could mitigate this by having a reference card, one card that the team agrees is medium, and all other cards can be compared to that when estimates are in question. Team members afraid to speak up. This could be mitigated by employing anonymity to votes or card placement.

Tasks:
* Choose your top three choices, and apply.
* Wait on responses and sign lease with the top choice that calls you back.

Estimate: 8

Columns I would have would be:
* To Do
* In progress
* Done
