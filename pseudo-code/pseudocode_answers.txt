1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode because it captures and presents algorithms in a manner that any programmer can understand independent of any particular programming language syntax. Therefore, pseudocode can be used to build algorithms and communicate them to programmers across multiple programming languages. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

 Nothing would happen. Pseudocode is not a machine language, and will not be read by a computer. 

 Programming Assignment

 1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

  GET first number
  GET second number
  IF first number is greater than second number THEN
    PRINT first number
  ELSE
    PRINT second number
  ENDIF

 2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

  SET number to 1
  WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
    PRINT number
    INCREMENT number by 1
  ENDWHILE

 3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

  GET phonebook entries
  GET search entry
  FOR each entry in phonebook
    IF search entry is EQUAL to entry in phonebook
      PRINT "Number found"
    ELSE IF search entry is NOT EQUAL to entry in phonebook AND loop reaches final iteration
      PRINT "No number found"
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

 4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

 const phoneBook = [1234567890, 2345678901, 3456789012];
 const findNumber = (array, search) => {
   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
     if(search === array[i]) {
       console.log("Number found");
     } else if (search !== array[i] && i === array.length - 1) {
       console.log("Number not found");
     }
   }
 }

 findNumber(phoneBook, 3456789012);
 findNumber(phoneBook, 4567890123);
