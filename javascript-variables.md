> Describe the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`.

A: `let` is used when you need to define a variable that is only scoped to a specific block of a funcion.
`var` is used to either define a variable outside or inside a function, and can be changed later. `var` applies to the entire function whereas `let` only applies to the specific block of a function.
`const` is used for a variable that is not going to change throughout your code.

**Code**

 >Using `var`, `let`, and `const` create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color.

 ```JavaScript

var state = 'CA';
const name = 'Raimond';
let hairColor = 'Brown';


 ```
