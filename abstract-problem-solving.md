> Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:

* What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
* What are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?
* What are the steps involved in making a cup of coffee?
* What are the steps involved in making a telephone call?

A: How to make a telephone call:
* At any point in the following steps if you are unable to complete the step with the notes provided, find the nearest person and ask them to help you.

1. Identify the telephone number you would like to call.
* Telephone numbers in the US are typically 10 digits and follow this format: \(\#\#\#\)\-\#\#\#\-\#\#\#\#
* Telephone numbers can be identified in many ways, more commonly by asking someone who already knows the telephone number, or by searching for the business or location on the internet. You can also use a telephone book, or you can skip to step 2, and when you reach the step to dial a telephone number, dial 411. 411 is an information line, and can provide you with a telephone number if it is listed in the public directory.

2. After you know what telephone number you would like to call, locate a working telephone.
* A telephone is a device that has a speaker, a microphone, a 12 button keypad, and a working connection to the public switched telephone network \(PSTN\) provided by a telephone company, or internet service provider.
* The keypad typically has numbers 0 \- 9 and the symbols \* and \#. The telephone is typically wireless, or directly connected by a wire to a base, that plugs into a telephone jack in the wall.
* On a mobile cellular telephone you may have to push a button to activate the screen, and locate an icon that looks like a telephone to bring the keypad up on the screen.

3. After you have located a telephone, check if it has a dial tone.
* A dial tone is an audible indicator that you can hear by placing the telephone up to your ear. It will be either a long steady tone, or a repeating beeping tone.
* If you have a wired telephone you simply pick the telephone up off the base, put it up to your ear, and listen. Make sure you are picking up the side with the speaker and microphone. Some older telephones may be exceptions to this, but the main purpose is to listen and identify a dial tone.
* If you have a wireless telephone you most likely need to push the call\/talk button to activate the telephone for use. The call\/talk button is usually labeled CALL or TALK or a small picture of a telephone, and it's usually the color green. After activating the telephone for use, put it up to your ear, and listen for a dial tone.
* If you hear a dial tone you can proceed to step 4.
* If you hear an automated message stating "If you would like to make a call please hang up and try again":
  * Using a wired telephone, put the telephone back onto the base so that it is fully seated around the edges and fits correctly. Then pick it back up and listen again. If it still has that automated message this is an indicator that another telephone is in use, and you will need to locate the telephone and hang it up. Search other rooms in the building you are in for other telephones, and make sure they are seated on their base, or deactivated. You should check each telephone as you find it, because once you hear a dial tone you are ready to proceed to step 4.
  * Using a wireless telephone, push the end button to end the call, or deactivate the telephone. Then repeat the above step to check for a dial tone on a wireless telephone. The end button is usually labeled END, or a small picture of a telephone, and is usually the color red. If it still has that automated message this is an indicator that another telephone is in use, and you will need to locate the telephone and hang it up. Search other rooms in the building you are in for other telephones, and make sure they are seated on their base, or deactivated. You should check each telephone as you find it, because once you hear a dial tone you are ready to proceed to step 4.
* If you hear no dial tone, then you need to go back to step 2 and locate a different working telephone.

4. After you have identified a dial tone, dial the telephone number you identified in step 1 using the 12 button keypad.
* Some telephone numbers require an additional number to be dialed at the beginning of the 10 digit number (Making it a total of 11 digits dialed). If this is the case, an automated message will inform you of this. You will need to progress to step 5 after dialing the number in order to hear the automated message. After hearing the automated message, deactivate the telephone, then repeat steps 3 and 4, this time dialing the additional digit before the 10 digit telephone number.

5. After dialing the telephone number, put the telephone up to your ear, listen, and be prepared to respond by talking back into the microphone of the telephone.
* At this point you have successfully made a telephone call, and you can have a conversation with the person on the other end of the call. After the telephone conversation, proceed to step 6.

6. After you are finished with the telephone conversation, end the telephone call, so the telephone is ready for use the next time you want to make a telephone call.
* Using a wired telephone, put the telephone back onto the base so that it is fully seated around the edges and fits correctly.
* Using a wireless telephone, push the end button to end the call, or deactivate the telephone.

Congratulations, you have successfully made a telephone call.

> In our "Say Hi" example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?

A: Isolate the problem by working backwards from "Say Hi" to the previous step, and continuing with each step until you locate where the program functioned properly. At that point you know that between the step working properly, and the next step is where your problem lies.

> What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?

A:
Step 1: \[User Name Input\]
Step 2: \[User Button Click\]
Step 3: \[Say Hi\]

Start at Step 3, go back to Step 2, then to Step 1, until you identify where the problem began. Implement a fix, then test again, and repeat until your program works from Step 1 all the way through to Step 3.
